# Typing-speed-test
Built with vanilla JavaScript. This is a minimalistic and fairly simple typing speed test. It generates random song lyrics from lyrics.js file that I put together. It provides feedback on typos during the test. After you complete the test or if the timer runs out, you will be presented with your results on WPM, # of mistakes, accuracy, and the time taken to complete.
